# GSheet MySQL Sync

### Project Description:
This project implements a real-time synchronization system between Google Sheets and MySQL databases. It detects changes in either platform and ensures that updates, insertions, and deletions are instantly reflected in the other system. The solution supports full CRUD operations, avoids duplicate entries, and minimizes synchronization time by updating only the modified data. Designed to handle data consistency, it efficiently manages real-time communication between Google Sheets and MySQL, providing an optimized approach for seamless data integration across both platforms.
